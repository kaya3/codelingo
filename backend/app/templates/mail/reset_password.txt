Somebody (probably you) asked to reset your Codelingo password for the account named {{ username }}.

If you made this request yourself, you may now log in to Codelingo with the temporary password below. You will then be asked to choose a new password.

>>> Temporary password: {{ tmp_pw }}

If you did not ask to reset your password, please ignore and delete this email.
